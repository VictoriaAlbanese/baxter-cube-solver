# baxter-cube-solver
This repo will hold all of the material related to my honors project, where I will try to enable Baxter, a two armed robot in the UML Robotics Lab, to solve a Rubik's cube. :)

## Current Work
Baxter successfully moves his arm over the cube, makes adjustments, and then picks up the cube in many different positions.  Next steps are to fix bugs in the functionality, improve the robustness of the square finding algorithm, and clean up/refactor the existing code.

   - adjust initial height
   - make square-finding algorithm more robust
   - restrict area looked at by point cloud
   - clean up classes
   - refactor main
   
 Also on the list may be to make baxter ambidexterous, to better define on the table which areas are "out of reach", to  take nice videos of it all working, and do a brief analysis on his success rate.
 
   - make baxter ambidexterous 
   - define areas that are "out of reach"
   - take nice videos
   - quick success rate analysis
