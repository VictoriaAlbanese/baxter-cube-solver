# baxter-cube-solver
This repo will hold all of the material related to my honors project, where I will try to enable Baxter, a two armed robot in the UML Robotics Lab, to solve a Rubik's cube with humanoid movements, utilizing all seven degrees of freedom that his arms offer. This includes picking up the cube from a non-predetermined location, reading the colors of the cubies, developing an algorithm which returns a sequence of moves which, when performed, will solve the cube, and, finally, enabling Baxter to perform that sequence of moves on the cube.  I achieved success in all four parts of my project in varying degrees; however, I was not able to enable Baxter to solve the Rubikâ€™s cube.  I have, however, produced a sufficient proof of concept, crafted an impressive demo, and have laid a solid foundation for this project to be completed in the future.
